<h2><a href="https://archive.org/details/jamendo-043366">Rapid Eye Movement</a> - The Glass Spider (Resistance, 2009)</h2>
<p>If you like weird moaning in rock songs, this is for you. Plus it's Free. Link to the archive.org page. But you can find it on jamendo too.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6ljFaKRTrI">Still Alove</a> - Jonathan Coulton (Portal, 2007)</h2>
<p>Credits soundtrack from Portal. Makes me almost cry. You can download the song for free from vavle's website.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.jamendo.com/track/1247373/franco-frunky">Franco Frunky</a> - Boom Boom Beckett (Boom Boom Baby, 2015)</h2>
<p>Great song if you're into jazz. To Be a Master P. is my favourite song from the album.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbuC8u1AnM">Yeh Mera Dil</a> - Shankar Eshaan (Don, 2006)</h2>
<p>Threre is something about the sound of early-2000s Indian rock that just draws me towards it. This song included.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y57siuuoX8">Raja Raja Raja</a></h2>
<a>Nope...</a>
