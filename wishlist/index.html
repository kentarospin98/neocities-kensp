<hr>
<p>Is my birthday coming up? Am I your sempai and do you want my attention? Do you have a crush on me and want to impess me? Do you have too much money in your hands? Well, you've come to the right place. Here is a list if things I want.</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<p>I Love games. I buy most my games from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com">Steam</a>, but I prefer DRM free games. (Like from <a href="https://www.gog.com">GOG</a> or <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com">Humble Store</a>) Physical editions are a godsend. I have a <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198145654617/wishlist">Steam wishlist</a>, so you can look around. I mostly only play games that have a <b>Native Linux release</b>.</p>
<h2>Music</h2>
<p>I mostly download music from youtube, buy it on google play music, Steam (Videogame music is my Jam!) or get libre music from <a href="https://www.archive.org">The Internet archive</a>. I really want <a href="https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/minecraft-volume-alpha">Minecraft Volume Aplha</a> and <a href="https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/minecraft-volume-beta">Minecraft Volume Beta</a> by C418. Gotta get hands on those FLACS! I have a <a href="https://bandcamp.com/kensp/wishlist">Bandcamp Wishlist</a> if you'd like to go through it. Again, Physical releases are <b>THE BEST</b></p>
<h2>More Coming soon</h2>
<p>I love Stuff. I'd add more Stuff about Stuff I Love soon</p>
