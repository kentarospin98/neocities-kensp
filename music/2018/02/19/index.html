<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvyqm72k4pQ">Rehena Tu</a> - A. R. Rahman (Delhi 6, 2011)</h2>
<p>Another one of A. R. Rahman's master pieces. The kind of song you listen to on a long ride. If you do not understand Hindi, you can look at the <a href="http://www.bollymeaning.com/2011/08/rehna-tu-hai-jaisa-tu-lyrics.html">translations</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.jamendo.com/track/1190458/gabriel">Gabriel</a> - Boogie Belgique (Nightwalker Vol. 2, 2015)</h2>
<p>Great album, really catchy song. All free. It's a bit of a fusion of Retro-vinyl-hip-hop and modern Electronic.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5aYZx_xTKs">Angry Birds Theme, Fast Jazz Stride Piano Cover</a> - Dave Wave (2015)</h2>
<p>Dave puts a lot of effort in these covers, and its just amazing to look at his fingers move like that. This is one of my favorites. Extremely polished, and just as awesome as the original.</a>
<h2><a href="https://motionstudies.bandcamp.com/album/i-cant-do-without-you">I Can't Do Without You</a> - Motion Studies (I Can't Do Without You, 2018)</h2>
<p>Released just a few weeks ago. Its part of a two track "album". Couldn't not add it to my party list.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ygdAiDxKfI">Ievan Polkka</a> - Loituma</h2>
<p>For this weeks whimsical entry: Leek Spin. Gotta admit, we all secretly listen and love this sing. Loituma actually some really great tracks, and you might see them in next week's list.</p>
